# C# / .NET OpenAI GPT-4 Assistant for Local File Search

This is small sample project that shows you how to:

- upload local files to the OpenAI GPT-4 Assistant service on either Azure OpenAI service or the OpenAI API
- Use the File Search tool on Azure OpenAI Service
- Ask natural language questions about the file
- Keep the conversation thread active for follow up questions

Presented as a single Program.cs .NET 8.0 Console app.

To use the compiled app, the first parameter must be that to a local file, or on Windows you can drag and drop the file onto the compiled .exe. Tested pretty extensively with PDF files.
